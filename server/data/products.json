    "description": "Meticulously crafted from solid reclaimed elm wood and anchored on a solid pine base, this dining table has a unique origin. Our supplier buys ornate doors from local villagers that carry the marks of a long, useful life. These aged elm doors are then skilfully repurposed and transformed using traditional carpentry methods to create something new and beautiful. This charming table has already stood the test of time, displaying textures and depth that only come from age, and ensuring each piece is one of a kind and unlike any other. ",
